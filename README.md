# Class-Snps: SNP Effect Classifier

**Class-snps** is a Python command-line utility for **classifying Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)** and Indels found in genome alignment data. It determines the functional impact of coding SNPs by translating the reference and alternate codons to classify them as **synonymous** or **non-synonymous**.

This tool is designed to process output generated by the MUMmer software suite (`show-snps`).

## Features

* **SNP Classification:** Distinguishes between:
    * **Synonymous:** No change in the resulting amino acid.
    * **Non-synonymous:** Change in the resulting amino acid.
    * **Intergenic:** Located outside of annotated coding sequences (CDS).
* **Indel Identification:** Marks insertions/deletions (`.` in the alternate base) as "indel."
* **Genome Integration:** Uses GFF3 annotation and a reference FASTA file to precisely locate and classify variants within coding sequences.
* **Output:** Results are printed to the console and can be saved to a structured CSV file.


## Requirements

This script is written in Python 3 and relies on the Biopython library.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/class-snps.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/class-snps.git)
    cd class-snps
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install biopython
    ```

##  Usage

The script requires three primary input files: a GFF3 annotation file, the SNP file from MUMmer, and the reference FASTA file.\
```bash
python class_snps.py \
    -a annotation.gff3 \
    -s snps_output_mummer.txt \
    -f reference.fasta \
    -o results.csv
```


### Command Structure

```bash
python class_snps.py -a <GFF3_FILE> -s <SNP_FILE> -f <FASTA_FILE> [OPTIONS]
```
## Output Overview

The script produces a tabular output with six main columns that classify each genomic variant. Key fields include: the position (1-based genomic coordinate), the ref and alt bases (showing the mutation), the gene ID and strand (providing the context of the location), and the crucial effect classification. The effect determines the variant's functional impact, categorized as intergenic (non-coding), indel (insertion/deletion), synonymous (no change in amino acid) , or non-synonymous (a change in amino acid) .
